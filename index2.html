				<div class="boxx4">When the most-awaited seasons approach, we also transform our menu and match it with the occurring season. For example, last Christmas we released the Gifted Collection 2018, some of the most recommended and the highlights of the collection is the Smoothie Bowl with sugar-glazed Snow men with coconut flakes as toppings. We also served the dish called Reindeer Gelato, Mug smoothies with matching seasonal mugs that we manufacture from our own factory, we get really creative not only in our dishes and foods but also in the bowls, mugs, glasses themselves since it also plays a vital role when talking about the overall impact and aura of the dish! Jolly!</div>
				<div class="boxx5">We just do not serve smoothies of different varieties. We also have the Breakfast Collection that is available every morning until 11:00 am. We shift our menu to its original form after the scheduled time for Breakfast! A highlight from the collection is these two Oatmeal Bowls with fruits on the side, we want them to also have choices so we also included oatmeal bowls. I mean like, who does not want an oatmeal and fruits for breakfast? None! Who wants smoothies so early in the morning? Absolutely none! The fruits we serve in our dishes are freshly produced and picked from our Variety Farm, we get all our produce here, herbs, flowers, garnishes, fruits, the milk for ice creams and gelatos and many many more! We want to offer the people the freshest ingredients for quality!</div>
				<div class="boxx6">Like we said earlier, we match our menu to the season happening! So here it is, for the Halloween Season, the Spook Collection. We got more creative here since we wanted to aim for dishes that is very creepy and spooky but at the same time cute and visually appealing! Here are the highlights, A smoothie bowl made from Glycyrrhiza glabra a herb that is topped with cute Caspers, now you know we also use weird and exotic ingredients! Our Creative Team which is responsible for the very unique toppings and combinations works hard to bring out the best from the wide variety of ingredients we have, we wanted to maximize the usage to avoid throwing spoiled produce. We do not want to waste since we donâ€™t want to throw away the blood and sweat of our farmers.</div>
