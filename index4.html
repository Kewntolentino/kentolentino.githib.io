					<div class="boxofme1">After the Pastry Section, you are now here in the last section and one of the cutest ones, the Snacks Section! So as you can see, we have a lot to offer in our Snacks Menu. Here is the first one, we serve unique Cupcakes like this one! This is also included in the famous Cosmic Collection, this is called the Space Whip, here we used edible glitters for the first time and it went great! All kinds of these are served chilled. Of course! Who wants to eat warm cupcakes? None isnt it? From the above showcase section which is above, you can see we also serve waffles, crepes and many many more! Check these out! </div>

				<div class="box">This one beside this is called the Chocolate Orchard since it is like a chocolate mania mixed with fruit frenzy! This one is a special pick of the costumers since according to them, the snack conveys a very Royal theme. Our very very vast variety of snacks is also for the sweet teeth out there. So come to us now and experience the Sugar Galore! Experience our new creations these 2019. We will make sure this year will be remarkable and a lot has been prepared for Starlight Cuisine for the people to eat! </div>

				<div class="boxofme2">Aside from cupcakes and the like. We also serve fancy and out of this world Donuts! We have a lot of them for you to pick and swallow. Another fact, our Donuts are fried to order, so when you eat Donuts in the Starlight Cuisine, it is fresh like the air in the Forest Morning! This Donut is called the NASA, it was inspired by Ariana Grandeâ€™s backdrop screen in her Sweetener World Tour which is still ongoing! And by the way, obviously this Donut is included in the Cosmic Collection, one of our core menus and the heart of the Starlight Cuisine! The planets that we topped in these donuts are made from marshmallow fluff coated with glaze! Interesting? </div>

				<div class="boxx4">This one is also included in the Cosmic Collection and also in the Sunburst Collection that we have right now since it is summer at its best! Popsicles are also one of our fields that we work on, here we can explore more of our capabilities since designing unique popsicles are a bit out of our comfort zone! Do you ask yourself, how can they do these amazing visuals in their popsicles? Well, it is our secret! Do you think we have a secret alien race that provide us ingredients in making these space-themed foods? Well, you will never know! So this one is called Dipped in Space It has our gradient feature we also used a secret ingredient where it looks like stars!</div>
				<div class="boxx5">This part of our menu is the only one if its kind, it is our special edition Cake Tea! It is just simply a Tea, with a cake stabbed with straw on top! So this gold is included in our Cosmic Collection and Unicorn Collection, this one became a top Instagram Lovers pick. So here is the Sweet Daze it is fixed as 2 pairs of drinks one is Sakura and the other is Burdock Root! The Two cakes above them is a unicorn head themed cake slice and the other on is somehow related to the Moonstarred Cake which was shown earlier. You can also choose if you just want to order one of them. Either way they are both tasty like the Unicorns!</div>
				<div class="boxx6">This one is from the Confession Collection, it is entitled as the Queen of Hearts, it is made up of a specific number of strawberries depending on your choice! Each strawberry served are designed uniquely since we do not follow a design template, it depends on our Food Designer on how she designs the strawberries. All of the strawberries are dipped and glazed with Pink-colored white chocolate and designed! The design can also be decided by the costumer. For us, it can be used as a Valentines Day Gift to our loved one since the Confession Collection is released only in February, the month of love!</div>
