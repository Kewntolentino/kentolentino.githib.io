					<div class="boxofme1">Let us take a break from Smoothie Frenzy! Now we are here in the second part, the Pastries and the Like! So as you can see, obviously, these are all about Cakes of different styles and surprises, in this section you can witness how far did we go from reinventing pastries! So let us start! The first one you see here is an example of Volcano Cake which is also like a Lava Cake, it can be served chilled or baked to order! We recommend buying these with the fruit drinks to complement the taste. One thing to note, we also serve cakes and pastries in a chopping board! Uniquely funny is not it? </div>

				<div class="box">Do you wonder how did we able to make floating mugs pouring out strawberry and chocolate syrups? Well, it is the art of pastry making, sometimes we also cannot believe the things we create from the costumers orders! We love exploring new heights in the Art of Food Preparation, even though we proved we are proficient in it, we always strive to be better since we want the best for the people who keep loving us! Cakes like these are a bit complex to make but with our Pastry Team, it is just an easy task to keep up with since they are composed of Professional ones that dedicated themselves in to food preparation. </div>

				<div class="boxofme2"> Another one from our famous Cosmic Collection, this cake is called the Moonstarred Cake, it is inspired by the Dreamworks Inc.s film introduction, we just added a little twist which is the Space-theme! This one became a favorite of the Gen Z! We wanted one to keep up with the trends, so we made the base glaze like a combination of Space and Mirror Glaze. The meringues on the top is banana flavored as well as the frosting used in the tiny accents! Is it stellar? We want a surprise for the new costumers so do not want to reveal what is inside the cake. It is a mystery and once discovered, WORTH IT!</div>

				<div class="boxx4">Another famous collection will be revealed here and it is the upcoming Unicorn Collection, this is one of the most-awaited dish from the Unicorn Collection menu since it is very new for the market. This one is called the Unicorn Murder, as you can see it will be served with a waiter slicing it in front of you, or you can have a choice to slice it yourself! This cake has three versions, the first one is the previewed one which is the rainbow-layered cake, the second being the all-new and first time in the Starlight Cuisine Crepe Cake and Chiffon cake. This one and the whole collection will come out from the clouds soon! Another preview will come later in the Snacks Page! Don not miss it!

				<div class="boxx5">This one is also new, maybe the first one in the world! This is our very own signature The Literal Fruit Cake. This one is made with legitimately 100% fruits like Watermelon dominantly as the base and layers, strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, raspberries and a mango that is a star (I know, we could have used Star Fruit to become more literal), the frosting is also made from brewed fruit. This is made to order since its main ingredient is fruits. It is prepared by expert fruit slicers we hired from Philippines which has been slicing fruits professionally since he was a kid. Amazing? Experience really plays a bit impact, he was just a humble slicer back then, but now he is working in foreign countries. You might never know the fruit of you hard work. Is it?</div>
				<div class="boxx6">We not only serve literal and unique cakes. We also serve fresh pies with very amazing top layers. We have a lot of these but this one is special since it is from the Cosmic Collection again! Cant you see the solar system? It is right there obviously, is it? So we made these again from fresh fruits! The costumers can have their choice of fruit and they can explain or draw the design they want, it us up to you! The Dough we made can also be chosen since there are a lot of costumers who prefer different types. With or without Gluten dough, Wheat Dough, Rye Dough, and many more, you know we wanted our restaurant to cater to all types of people, Food Lovers and Vegetarians alike.</div>
